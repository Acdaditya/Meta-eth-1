# TV Show Token

TV Show Token (TVT) is a simple ERC-20-like token implemented in Solidity. This smart contract allows for minting and burning tokens while maintaining a mapping of balances for different addresses.

## Requirements

1. **Public Variables:**
   - `name` - The name of the token.
   - `abbr` - The abbreviation of the token.
   - `totalSupply` - The total supply of the token.

2. **Mapping:**
   - A mapping of addresses to their token balances (`address => uint`).

3. **Mint Function:**
   - Increases the total supply by a specified amount and credits the sender's balance.

4. **Burn Function:**
   - Decreases the total supply by a specified amount and debits the sender's balance.
   - Includes conditionals to ensure the sender's balance is sufficient to burn the specified amount.

## Contract Details

/*
       REQUIREMENTS
    1. Your contract will have public variables that store the details about your coin (Token Name, Token Abbrv., Total Supply)
    2. Your contract will have a mapping of addresses to balances (address => uint)
    3. You will have a mint function that takes two parameters: an address and a value. 
       The function then increases the total supply by that number and increases the balance 
       of the “sender” address by that amount
    4. Your contract will have a burn function, which works the opposite of the mint function, as it will destroy tokens. 
       It will take an address and value just like the mint functions. It will then deduct the value from the total supply 
       and from the balance of the “sender”.
    5. Lastly, your burn function should have conditionals to make sure the balance of "sender" is greater than or equal 
       to the amount that is supposed to be burned.

contract TVShowToken {

    string public constant name = "TV Show Token";
    string public constant abbr = "TVT";
    uint public totalSupply = 0;

    // Mapping for token balances
    mapping(address => uint) public balances;

    // Mint function 
    function mint(address addr, uint amount) public {
        totalSupply += amount;
        balances[addr] += amount;
    }

    // Burn function 
    function burn(address addr, uint amount) public {

## Functions

### mint

```solidity
function mint(address addr, uint amount) public
```

- **Parameters:**
  - `addr`: The address to mint tokens to.
  - `amount`: The amount of tokens to mint.
- **Description:** This function increases the total supply by the specified `amount` and adds the same amount to the balance of `addr`.

### burn

```solidity
function burn(address addr, uint amount) public
```

- **Parameters:**
  - `addr`: The address to burn tokens from.
  - `amount`: The amount of tokens to burn.
- **Description:** This function decreases the total supply by the specified `amount` and subtracts the same amount from the balance of `addr`. It requires that the balance of `addr` is greater than or equal to the amount to be burned.
